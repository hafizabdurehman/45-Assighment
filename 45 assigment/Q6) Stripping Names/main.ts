
//Q6) Stripping Names: Store a person’s name,
//    and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
//    Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
//    Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//    Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
