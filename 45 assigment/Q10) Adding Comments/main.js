//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//                 If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
//                 just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
//                 Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
